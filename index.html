					<h1 class="align-center">Explore a bar full of hidden dramas, featuring twelve different audio plays with curated local music and special drinks.</h1>
					<hr>
					<p class="align-center" style="padding-bottom: 0;">There are few places where one is as surrounded by humanity and intrigue as in a bar, where strangers have chance encounters, old friends reconnect, drunks philosophize, lovers plot affairs and relationships fall apart. Come explore this world of hidden dramas at <em>Earshot</em>, an innovative audio installation and theatrical environment that allows the audience to explore an eerily abandoned bar and eavesdrop on the recorded conversations of absent strangers. Featuring twelve original scripts from eleven different writers, <em>Earshot</em> is a paean to the diversity, and frequent absurdity, of the lives and stories around us every day. The objects left behind at the bar provide clues to the identities of the speakers, while curated local music and special drinks keep this empty bar buzzing.</p>
					<p class="align-center" style="padding-bottom: 0;">
					In 2015, Earshot had six successful shows in Bonnie Vee in the Lower East Side and Kilo Bravo in Williamsburg. Check out our feature on <a href="http://www.culturebot.org/2015/04/23797/jaime-sunwoos-earshot-a-theatrical-sound-installation-at-bonnie-vee-and-kilo-bravo/" target="_blank">Culturebot.</a> 
					</p>

								<h6>Bellows<span class="plusminus"></span></h6>
								<p>Bellows is the bedroom recording project of songwriter and producer Oliver Kalb. The sound of Bellows is sensory and delicate, subtle and quiet but erupting with frantic wobbling drums, large orchestral sections and bursts of noise that push the conventions of pop and folk. Started in late 2010 in a college dorm room, Bellows has since blossomed from solo recording experiment into a large-scale rock band, employing the help of The Epoch art collective to bring Kalb's intimate home recordings to life on stage. Bellows' latest record <em>Blue Breath</em> was recorded over the course of three years, in five bedrooms across the country, and was released in 2014 on Dead Labour. The record was recorded by layering dozens of strange sounds over would-be humble folk songs, the result being a soaring pop record that treads the line between minuscule and gigantic. <em>Blue Breath</em> was named one of Bob Boilen of NPR's All Songs Considered's favorite records of 2014.

								<h6>THR﻿OW VISION<span class="plusminus"></span></h6>
								<p>THROW VISION entered the studio to record their debut album, In I, just months after forming in the Spring of 2012. In I carries a sound that is undeniably "Throw Vision," bringing together diverse influences &mdash; Debussy, Animal Collective and Here We Go Magic &mdash; on top of soulful pulses of r&amp;b and jazz.​ In March 2013, Throw Vision was voted Deli Magazine's "NYC Artist of the Month." Today, the band continues to make music and is releasing their next album in Spring 2015.
